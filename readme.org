* Functional Programming presentation

This is a talk I made where I work to show a little bit of functional programming in JS.

You can see a version in [[file:presentation.org][english]] and in [[file:presentation-BR.org][portuguese]].

All the examples used in the presentation can be seen complete in the [[file:examples/][examples]] directory
